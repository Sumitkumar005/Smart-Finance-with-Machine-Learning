#  Estimation of the potential losses an investment portfolio could face over a specified period for a given confidence interval.

'''
One common approach is to use a machine learning model to predict future returns, and then calculate VaR based on these predictions.
Below is an example using a Random Forest model to predict future stock returns and subsequently calculate VaR.
'''

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate synthetic stock returns data
# In a real-world application, you would fetch this data from a reliable source
np.random.seed(42)
n_data_points = 1000
stock_returns = np.random.normal(0, 1, n_data_points)

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(stock_returns, columns=['Returns'])

# Feature engineering: use lagged returns as features
for i in range(1, 6):
    df[f'Lag_{i}'] = df['Returns'].shift(i)

# Remove NaN
df = df.dropna()

# Split into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop('Returns', axis=1)
y = df['Returns']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Calculate VaR
confidence_level = 0.05
VaR = np.quantile(y_pred, confidence_level)

print(f'Value-at-Risk (VaR) at {confidence_level * 100}% confidence level is {VaR}')

# Plot predicted returns and VaR
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(y_pred, bins=30, alpha=0.75, color='blue', label='Predicted Returns')
plt.axvline(x=VaR, color='r', linestyle='--', label=f'VaR at {confidence_level * 100}% confidence level')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Return')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Value-at-Risk (VaR) using Machine Learning')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Explanation:

Generate Synthetic Stock Returns: The code generates synthetic stock return data for demonstration purposes.

Feature Engineering: Lagged returns are used as features for the machine learning model.

Train-Test Split: The data is split into training and test sets.

Random Forest Model: A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the data.

Prediction: The model predicts future returns on the test set.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Calculate VaR: VaR is calculated based on predicted returns using the numpy quantile function.

Plot: The predicted returns and VaR are plotted.

The red line in the plot indicates the VaR at a 5% confidence level. According to this model, we are 95% confident that the worst daily loss will not exceed this value.

Note: This is a very simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the data would be more complex, and additional steps such as data normalization, hyperparameter tuning, and validation would be necessary.
