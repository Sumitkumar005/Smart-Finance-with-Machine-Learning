1. Satellite Image Providers: Platforms like Sentinel Hub, NASA EarthData, or even Google Earth Engine can provide the raw satellite images
 you'd need.
2. Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV for basic image processing tasks, or specialized libraries like Rasterio for geospatial data.
3. Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch for any predictive models you might want to develop.
4. Data Visualization: Libraries like Matplotlib for static charts or Dash/Plotly for interactive dashboards.
