# Step 1: Load Historical Data for Two Merging Companies
# Assuming you have CSV files for both companies, we load them into dataframes.

# Sample CSV for company A and company B (assuming columns like 'revenue', 'cost', 'profit', etc.)
company_a_data = pd.read_csv('company_a_data.csv')  # Replace with actual path to your data
company_b_data = pd.read_csv('company_b_data.csv')  # Replace with actual path to your data

# Example of historical data (financial metrics):
# 'revenue', 'cost', 'profit', 'employees', 'R&D_spend', 'marketing_spend'

# Step 2: Preprocess the data
# Combine both companies' data and align by common financial metrics

# Example feature engineering: Combine the data into one dataframe and generate features.
# For simplicity, we'll combine the data from both companies and assume they have common columns.
# You can add more features based on your dataset.

company_a_data['company'] = 'A'
company_b_data['company'] = 'B'

# Concatenate the dataframes into one
combined_data = pd.concat([company_a_data, company_b_data], axis=0)

# Feature engineering: Generate features for synergies (e.g., potential cost savings, revenue growth)
# Here we assume cost and revenue synergies based on the companies' individual financial data.
combined_data['cost_saving'] = combined_data['cost'] * 0.05  # Assume 5% cost savings on average
combined_data['revenue_synergy'] = combined_data['revenue'] * 0.10  # Assume 10% revenue growth from merger

# Define features (X) and target variable (y)
# Target: 'synergy' as combined savings and revenue synergies from the merger
X = combined_data[['revenue', 'cost', 'profit', 'employees', 'R&D_spend', 'marketing_spend']]
y = combined_data['cost_saving'] + combined_data['revenue_synergy']

# Step 3: Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Initialize the model (RandomForest Regressor)
model = Rand
